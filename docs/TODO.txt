The immediate to do list (in no particular order)

#TODO: move ir::detail::{Scalar, Parameter} out of the 
  detail namespace, as they are used more extensively 
  and outside of the ir itself.



#TODO: rename the 'codegen' directory to something more meaningfull.
  It's the directory for all of the runtime facilities as expressed 
  as generators of llvm ir.
  alt; backend runtime llvmgen


#TODO: add a proper function class, allow them
to be coerced into lambda's for the purposes of
passing as arguments. and allow the user to specify 
a main subroutine, in order to gen executables.

#TODO: add a compound body syntax to lambdas,
  and properly handle lookup and ubd between 
  lambda's and functions. 
  (namely, enforce the non-capturing aspect of 
   lambdas.)
