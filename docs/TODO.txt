The immediate to do list (in no particular order)

#TODO: move ir::detail::{Scalar, Parameter} out of the 
  detail namespace, as they are used more extensively 
  and outside of the ir itself.
  #NOTE:
  Scalar has been moved to ir/value as this makes sense.
  however, where does Parameter live? 


#TODO: add free function support, allow them
to be coerced into lambda's for the purposes of
passing as arguments. and allow the user to specify 
a main subroutine, in order to generate executables.
  #TODO: typecheck, evaluate, codegen, forwardDeclare, print, clone ir:Function


#TODO: add a compound body syntax to lambdas,
  and properly handle lookup and ubd between 
  lambda's and functions. 
  (namely, enforce the non-capturing aspect of lambdas.)

#TODO: add algebraic data types. Sum and Product.
