The immediate to do list (in no particular order)

#TODO: add fuzz testing. specifically the parser, the REPL,
and output executables. Though I admit I am struggling to 
think of a way 

#TODO: add free function support, allow them
to be coerced into lambda's for the purposes of
passing as arguments. 

#TODO: allow the user to specify a main subroutine.

#TODO: create native libraries and executables.

#TODO: parallelize compilation.

#TODO: replace tree style interpretation with something faster
(bytecode interpretation, or JIT?)

#TODO: add a compound body syntax to lambdas,
  and enforce the non-capturing aspect of lambdas.

#TODO: add algebraic data types. Sum and Product.
