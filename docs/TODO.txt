The immediate to do list (in no particular order)

#TODO: replace mint::Location with a string_view of the relevant source code 
      within the source buffer. mint::Source I think. Then usages of the 
      referenced source code can happen directly

#TODO: refactor the parser and lexer to use a SourceBuffer instead of 
        managing their own internal buffer

#TODO: add a list of all SourceBuffers opened by the current environment 
      to the environment.

#TODO: add a working stack of SourceBuffers to the parser, such that the 
      parser is able to safety switch between parsing one SourceBuffer and 
      another in order to implement the import mechanism, while keeping the 
      relevant source code around.

#TODO: add Source tracking to MIR instructions.
