"anything that can be done at compile time is done at compile time"


so, what can be done at compile time, and what cannot?

In general it is possible to interpret any information which 
is known at compile time. And Definitions must be made available 
to the runtime, for the runtime to make any sense at all.

the important thing to consider is what happens to a term which 
cannot be evaluated, only compiled. Due to that terms reliance upon 
data which is only knowable at runtime.

Comptime:
  Definitions
    Let 
    Module, Import 

  Expressions 
    Variables
    Binops 
    Unops

  Types 
    Nil 
    Boolean 
    Integer

  Values 
    nil 
    true, false 
    [0-9]+

Runtime:
  Definitions 
    Let 
    Module, Import
