How is main handled?

It is my inclination to specify that main is a function call main 
which is declared once and only once at global scope.

additionally it is my inclination to specify that a program compiled 
without a main is implicitly a library, and with a main is implicilty 
an executable.
but this misses the additional choice of shared vs. static library.
so probably isn't better than assuming executable unless specified otherwise.
