the main question is how do we interpret/compile definitions which 
rely upon names which are defined after they are used?

we can already typecheck this:

let x = 10;
let y = x;

this is because we can fully typecheck and evaluate 1.
then 2 relies on 1 and can also be typechecked and evalauted.

so how do we typecheck the reverse:

0)
let y = x;
let x = 10;

we will fail to type y with a use-before-def error. 
This error will hold the definition name reliant upon 
the undef name, as well as the undef name.
we store the definition itself (the ast) into a map with the undef name as 
the key.

then we encounter x, fully typecheck and evaluate it, then since we 
just created a new definition we try and resolve any use-before-def 
definitions held within the map under the newly defined name. since 
the definition of y is within the map under the name x the definition 
of y gets resolved here.

this works! :)

yet it only accounts for names defined at global scope.

so, how about use-before-def names within a module:

1)
module A {
  let a = b;
  let b = 1;
}

the issues here are:
A) we typecheck the entire module with a single function call,
  this means that we cannot rely on catching the use-before-def 
  error at the repl scope, we have to handle the use-before-def 
  error while we are attempting to typecheck the module itself.

B) the names we are defining and being used before they are defined 
  are qualified by the modules namespace. so how do we know what definition 
  of the undef name should be used to resolve the definition of a?
  I think it is obvious that the name that is used must be reachable by 
  lookup from the modules scope.

we can handle A by separating resolution of use-before-def into two parts.
we resolve the type, then the value. this however raises another issue 
with the typing of modules, we don't evaluate the terms within the module 
during typechecking, so we cannot rely on the evaluation step to create the 
bindings such that variable lookup can resolve types of variable usage within 
the module. said another way 

module A {
  let a = 1;
  let b = a;
}

also doesn't typecheck under the current strategy unless we create partial
bindings during typechecking for the subsequent definitions within the 
module to rely upon for their typechecking

we can naively address B by qualifying the names that are used before they are 
defined. thus: [let a = b;] will be mapped under [A::b] and not simply [b].
and subsequently when we resolve [let b = 1;] we lookup [A::b] and not simply [b].

and use-before-def names between modules:

2)
module A {
  let a = B::b;
}

module B {
  let b = 1;
}

or 
3)
module A {
  let a = b;
}

let b = 1;

2,3 raise a few issues, 

how do we resolve [let a = B::b] when we are currently 
processing module B? (and thus are within scope B)

how do we know when to qualify the use-before-def name?
if we are only considering cases 0,1, we can always qualify a 
use-before-def name with the namespace it appears in, because
that is the namespace the definition also appears in.

in the case of 2,3, we don't want to qualify the name,
and thus we don't want to lookup a qualified name.

however, there is not a difference between 3, and 1 
when all we see is 

module A {
  let a = b;

if we use
"the undef name as it was written"

then we need to revert back to using the unqualified names 
for storing and retreiving the use-before-def definitions.

this allows case 2 to naturally store the given name,
however we subsequently will not resolve the use-before-def 
unless we search for the unqualified name when we resolve
the definition of B::b. but then, how do we handle the case 
where we have 

4)
module A {
  let b = a;
}

module B {
  let c = a;
}

module A {
  let a = 1;
}

let a = 2;

...

as both A::b and B::c would be stored within the use-before-def 
under "a". though is this a problem? now both would be resolved 
when we resolve "a"?

but what if we then saw 



do both A::b and B::c resolve at this point?
well, no, only A::b should be resolved, because 
normal lookup does not find "A::a" within module 
B unless they explicitly use "A::a"
just "a" should only attempt to lookup in global scope,
so unless the case is that we see

let a = 1;

after case 4 we should not resolve both A::b and B::c at 
this point.

if we further consider the case of 
5)
module A {
  let a = b;
}

let b = 1;

module A {
  let b = 2;
}

do we want a = 1 or a = 2?

if we have a solution to case 3. that is, a resolves to 1 in case 3,
then that would force a = 1 in this case as well

this is the reverse of 

module A {
  let b = 2;
}

let b = 1;

module A {
  let a = b;
}

where we would unambiguously select a = 2.
due to the fact that we attempt to resolve 
unqualified names in the local scope before 
we try and resolve an unqualified name in any 
higher scope. Part of the reason for 
having local scopes at all is name shadowing.


so I would say that a = 2; in the reverse case as well.
to maintain consistency with the behavior of the compiler 
against your code no matter how you arrange the definitions.
the entire point of use-before-definition at all is to 
provide that.

this means that we only resolve a use-before-def to a 
higher scopes binding after we have read in the entire 
module. 
however, you cannot ever know what the end of the 
module is when you are in a repl.
because you can always ask for more input from the 
user.

if we only process files then we can say that once all 
the given input files are read in, that is when we assume 
that all module definitions are complete.
and then resolve the use-before-defs to the global and higher 
scopes.


but that doesn't fix the bug if we consider linking modules together from 
different calls to the compiler to produce
object files which are then linked into an executable.
so we would have to do something different to handle constructing 
the set of object files. as now the different compiler instances 
have to agree upon what is present within each module, 
without seeing the entire definition of the module.
in order to resolve use before definition.

lets see, we just have to consider these four cases applied 
across one or more input files. and in the case of a repl.

so, the first thing i notice is that case 1 (within a module) and the case where 
you have case 1 split across two input files are solved by 
the solution to case 1 iff the compiler reads both input files
one after the other.
ditto for case 0, in the global module. 

yeah, as long as we are talking about the same instance of the compiler 
reading both files, the solutions presented will work on the mutliple file 
case, because the input is being read into the environment sequentially 
no matter if it's from the repl, one file, or multiple files.

if we further assume a single thread for the set of input files, then 
we know this solution works for the whole set. as long as it works between 
two files. (as you can simply apply it working to two files to each new input 
file you read in for each file in the set)

the issue comes when considering two compiler instances (threads) or two 
compiler processes (calls), and stitching together object files which are 
independant of eachother. and the issue I can think of is this:

a use-before-def definition in file one which is processed only by compiler 1.
and the undef definition in file two, which is only processed by compiler 2.

the only way out of this situation is by forward declaration. that is the only 
way that we can get at least the type of the undef definition into compiler 1.
either the programmer supplies the forward declaration, or somehow compiler 2 
injects the definition into compiler 1.
the linker can be relied upon to connect the definition to it's usages in any 
file present in the emitted object files.
however this says nothing for the compiler which must generate the code that 
uses the definition.


okay, to save on scrolling back up:

2)
module A {
  let a = B::b;
}

module B {
  let b = 1;
}

or 
3)
module A {
  let a = b;
}

let b = 1;


how specifically do we imagine solving this?

well, i think we can solve 2 with minimal effort if 
we add an if check. if the undef variable is already 
qualified, then we do not add qualifications. thus, when 
we use the variable for binding we store "B::b" and then 
when we resolveUseBeforeDef we pass in the name "B::b"


in case 3, we may solve this by way of assuming that 
an unqualified use-before-def name is reffering to a 
local definition. (as we already do). Thus requiring 
programmers to spell 

module A {
  let a = ::b;
}

if they want a non-local binding.

this, you will note solves case 5, in such a 
way that both alternatives are sayable within 
the syntax:

5-1)
module A {
  let a = b;
}

let b = 1;

module A {
  let b = 2;
}

assigns a = 2

5-2)
module A {
  let a = ::b;
}

let b = 1;

module A {
  let b = 2;
}

assigns a = 1

additionally, it removes the ambiguity from the expectations 
of the compiler. we are no longer unsure if we want to expect 
more of module A to be defined or not. 5-1 implies that yes 
this definition within A is going to be resolved with more of 
module A later.
and 5-2 implies that no this definition is relying on global scope.

well what about case:
6)
module A {
  let a = B::b;

  module B {
    let b = 1;
  }
}

in this case we do want to add the namespace qualification 
to the undef name, because when "b" is defined it has the 
full name of "A::B::b".
in case:
2)
module A {
  let a = B::b;
}

module B {
  let b = 1;
}

we do not want to add namespace qualifications to 
the undef variable. because when b is defined it has 
the full name of "B::b" exactly what the programmer typed.

we have to pick one of them to be the reasonable default.
ideally we allow for both somehow.

well, we could default to case 6, and make the 
programmer have to specify case 2, by way of 
globally qualifying the undef name.
2)
module A {
  let a = ::B::b;
}

module B {
  let b = 1;
}

again we imply that unless the qualification says so, we assume 
that names appearing undef in a local scope are 
defined within that local scope, unless globally qualified.


if we make the assumption that the nearest reachable name 
which matches what the programmer typed is what get's bound 
to the use-before-def name. then we are back where we started,
as it now matters what order you specify your declarations,
just in a more subtle way. and the solution of use-before-def 
does not provide the stated goal, "it shouldn't matter what 
order I declare names, just that all names are given a declaration"
in order to meet that statement we have to allow for arbitrary 
reordering of program declarations without changing the underlying 
semantics of the program itself. 
in order to meet that goal, we have to assume that the programmer is 
going to type in the exact name they want to reference in use-before-def 
fashion. or, that lacking full qualification that they are typing in 
a name which is defined relative to the local module.

okay, so now we know how it is that names within multiple scopes 
with different qualifications and potentially the same variable 
name can all live in a single use-before-def table, without having 
to split that table exactly the way scopes are split.
(though, that might also solve this issue, it's just harder to 
think about for me.)
so now, how is it that we are going to be able to define the 
use-before-def definition when we encounter the definition of 
the undef name within another scope enitrely?
the only way i can think to solve this problem is by storing a 
pointer to the scope of the use-before-def definition 
in the use-before-def table alongside the use-before-def definition,
then when resolving the definition we simply enter that scope. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
so, given that name lookup automatically walks up the scope tree,
then we can already imagine situations where reordering declarations 
produces different semantics.

module A {
  let a = b;
  let b = 1;
}

let b = 2;

 => A::a = 1

vs.

let b = 2;

module A {
  let a = b;
  let b = 1;
}

 => A::a = 2

do we want order independant definitions?
yes. but, we are just going to have to accept this 
quirk if we want anonymous local scopes to work.
that is, functions, conditionals, loops, etc.

so this has a conflict with the idea of a local block of code.
that is, functions, conditionals, loops, things of that nature.
namely, any time we open up an anonymous local scope.
we are prevented from resolving names defined in the scope above.
if we want to allow the upwards traversal, then we come up against 
another problem. stemming from when we define a use-before-def we 
must use a specific undef name as the key. 
the question is do we qualify that key or not? 
- if we qualify it with the scope it appears in, then we are 
  assuming that the undef name is going to be local, meaning it is immaterial 
  if we do upwards resolution or not, the only way to resolve the use-before-def 
  is to define a local name. 

- if we do not qualify the undef name, then 
  similarly we are assuming a global name will resolve the use-before-def,
  and only global names will resolve the conflict.

to provide the most flexibility we need to allow either a global name 
or a local name to resolve the conflict. (unless the undef name is 
specifically globally qualified of course, or I suppose if it is 
namespace qualified, we also do not want to qualify it,
this implies to me that working with an unqualified name might be 
easier).

however this means we cannot easily use the standard library map as the 
use-before-def-map, because it requires a single name as the key,
further complicatig things.

if we bind to the unqualified undef name, then how does a local definition (which 
defines a qualified name) ever resolve the use-before-def?

well, we could lookup twice? that is, when we define a new name we lookup 
it's qualified name in the map, resolve those use-before-defs, then lookup 
it's unqualified name and resolve those use-before-defs. 
does this do anything weird?

not for case 0 or 1.
however, consider this:

module A {
  public let a = b;
}

module B {
  public let b = 1;
}

let b = 2;

if we resolve use-before-defs relying on unqualified "b" when we define "B::b"
then A::a will resolve to 1, despite the fact that a namespace qualifier is 
normally needed in order to resolve B::b.

when we encounter an unqualified undef name, we only want names 
defined in that scope or higher to resolve the name. that is we only want 
A::b or ::b to resolve A::a. and not B::b or any other modules definition of b.
however, since we store the qualified undef name, only A::b will currently 
resolve A::a.

in order to have ::b resolve a definition in the map relying on A::b, we 
would need to either add the qualification to ::b (makes little if any sense)
or remove the qualification from A::b.
if we choose to store the definition under the unqualified undef name,
then we naturally allow ::b to resolve A::b, however, now we have the 
reverse problem, where A::b does not resolve A::a.
in this situation we can have A::b resolve A::a only if we add a qualification 
to the undef name b, or we can remove the qualification of the definition 
A::b. 
this is just how we get the map lookup to resolve to the definition.
what we really want however, is to allow for either A::b or ::b to resolve 
A::a. whichever comes first. 

what if we never qualified any names. and instead we stored the use-before-def-map 
within the scope itself. then, whenever a name was defined in a given scope,
that definition was used to resolve the use-before-defs in the local ubd map 
and each subscopes ubd map.
in this way, when b was defined at global scope, it would be used to resolve 
"A::a" relying on b within the scope A. 
well, how would this work with the ability of the programmer to specify 
a qualified name? if the programmer specifies a qualified name, then 
resolution needs to use the qualified name. but that would mean that 
when a name was defined in a module, the name resolutiion would need to 
walk up a scope, and resolve any names relying on the qualified name.

unless the undef name is explicitly qualified that is. then we assume that the 
programmer knows which name that they want the definition to resolve to.

so, to resolve a use-before-def, in steps:
0) some local definition of x fails to typecheck with a use-before-def error.
    relying on the definition of y
1) we bind the definition of x in the local use-before-def map under the name y.
  this is along with the locally qualified and unqualified names of x, and the 
  locally qualified and unqualified names of y. 
then later:
2) y is typechecked, and thus we start trying to resolve any use-before-defs 
  in the local scope depending on y. 
 2a) iff x was in the local scope, then it's type is resolved here,
  allowing us to repeat step 2 with x now that we know it's type.
3) attempt to resolve any use-before-def defs in scopes lower than the local 
  scope relying on the def of y. 
  3a) if anything is resolved repeat from step 2 starting from that scope
  this step is meant to resolve use-before-def names which would be resolved 
  by normal lookup if the definitions appeared in another order.
  in this situation, the current definition would be matched by lookup of 
  unqualified y, or qualified y.
  i.e. a name in a lower scope defined relative to a name in a higher scope.
4) attempt to resolve any use-before-def defs in scopes higher than the local 
  scope relying on the def of y.
    this step is meant to resolve use-before-def names which would be resolved 
    by explicit name qualification if the definitions appeared in another order.
  4a) if anything is resolved repeat from step 2 starting from that scope 
  in this situation, the only way that lookup would resolve the current local 
  def would be in the outer scope qualified the name.



we could add a 'using' statement to provide aliases for names.
this would allow convenient naming in a local scope of public 
names defined in an outer scope.
or add such a feature to the import statement.

this adds a slight inconveinence to accessing global names from within 
modules (or functions), however, this is worth it in my opionion. as 
1) the names are still accessable
2) global name access is called out as such syntactically, making such 
  usage obvious to those reading the program.



case 7)
module A {
  let a = b;
}

module A {
  let b = 1;
}

case 7 is a slight simplification of case 2. 
where it's the same scope. however, it raises an issue (that 
is also present in case 2)
namely, we have relied on the definition of the undef name 
also being present within the modules definition, such that 
when we typecheck the module, we typecheck both definitions, 
this partially resolves the use-before-def of definition a.
removing it from the map.
which allows the evaluation of the module to fail with 
use-before-def of a, and rebind it into the map. 
however, when the definition of b appears after the module 
block that a appears in ends, then we are going to typecheck 
and then evaluate the definition of a without ever partially 
resolving the use-before-def, meaning we add the definition to 
the map twice. 
we need to stop adding the term twice. or turn that into a no-op.
however, either way, we still need to both typecheck and evaluate 
the term.

what if we change partial resolve to not remove the binding, and instead 
only remove the use-before-def binding when we fully resolve the use-before-def.
well, this means that we need to not add the binding back again when 
it fails to evaluate, but only if it's a use before def?



(side note: this concept of normal ordering is incoherent when 
considering parallel compilation. how does use-before-def work 
when multiple files are compiled simultaneously? it would seem 
that each compilier instance would need access to the full definition 
of everything, implying that each compiler would fully process 
the entire dependency tree from a given file. implying duplicate work 
if two files being compiled have the same dependency.
note that there is this same duplicate work when considering bringing 
forward declarations into files in a c style compilation where the text 
of each file is similarly brought into each separate compilation process.)

algorithm:
part one:
when a definition fails to typecheck with a use-before-def error 
we save that definition in it's local scope's ubd-map.
the map stores one key, the identifier typed by the programmer 
which was not yet defined.

part two:
when a definition succeeds typechecking, we search for any potential 
ubds within the current scope tree, and attempt to resolve them.
(ditto for when a definition succeeds evaluation and code-generation.)


we are going to have a single global ubd map, what are the consequences?

well, we only need a single key: the qualified name.
(and can only have a single key, as there is no other way of 
distinguishing between entries within a single map.)

it simplifies lookup from it's current state, as it removes 
the need to traverse a tree when doing ubd resolution. 

it adds a wrinkle to cases 1)
module A {
  public let a = b;
  public let b = 1;
}

and 3)
module A {
  public let a = b;
}

public let b = 1;

as here we want the local definitions to bind together.
but we will not find the local definition when searching using the 
qualified name of the local definition.

how do we resolve a local ubd definition to another local definition.

this comes down to what we assume about an unqualified ubd.
if we give it no qualifications, then we will never resolve
it to a qualified definition. (1)

we can resolve case 1 by matching the name of the scope the def 
appears in to the name of the scope the ubd def appears in. 
since it is the same scope, we can allow an unqualified match to 
be found by ubd lookup.

then, by the fact that the qualified global variable matches the 
unqualified local name, ubd lookup will resolve case 3 naturally.

if we give it qualifications then we will never resolve it
to an unqualified definition. (3)

// #NOTE:
// if we consider a set of scopes (x0, x1, ..., xN)
// which are descending subscopes, defined as
// module x0 {
//   module x1 {
//     ...
//     module xN { ... } ... }}
// then a variable appearing in scope xA
// (where A is-in [0...N])
// is reachable by unqualified lookup from any scope xB
// (where B >= A and B <= N)

// if we consider a set of sets of scopes
// a0, a1, ..., aM
// where each (a0, a1, ..., aM)
// is-a set of descending subscopes (a0_0, a0_1, ..., a0_N)
// then a variable within scope xA_B
// (where A is-is [0...N] and B is-in [0...M])
// is reachable by unqualified lookup from any scope xC_D
// (where (A <= C <= N) and (B <= D <= M))

// additionally, any possible scope is a subscope of global scope

// that is, a variable is only reachable by unqualified lookup
// from a subscope of the defining scope of the variable.

so, we can solve this by computing if the ubd definition is within 
a subscope of the new definition. because if it is, then unqualified 
lookup will resolve the ubd definition given the new definition.

This solution does not address qualified lookup however. where lookup 
can traverse down the scope tree to resolve the ubd definition.
in this case what we want to check is if by traversing the scope tree 
via the undef name, we can resolve the new definition.

case ?) 
module A {
  public let a = B::a;
  module B {
    public let a = 1;
  }
}

when A::B::a is defined, it searches the UBD map for "A::B::a" 
which does not match the undef name "B::a" that definition A::a
relies on. however, we can notice that the undef name is within 
the new definition name. 
A::B::a 
   B::a 
as long as we ignore the first scope.

can we leverage this?
is there a way of writing modules which would give a false positive here?

if we consider a set of scopes (x0, x1, ..., xN)
which are descending subscopes, defined as
module x0 {
  module x1 {
    ...
    module xN { ... } ... }}
then a variable a appearing in scope xA
where 0 <= A <= N
can resolve a variable b in a lower scope xB 
where A <= B <= N 

if the variable a uses the qualifications of scopes 
between xA and xB 

qualified a is: x0::x1::...::xA::a 
qualified b is: x0::x1::...::xA::x(A+1)::...::xB::b 

for a to be defined relative to b, a's reference to b 
must include all qualifications between a and b,
thus: x(A+1)::...::xB::b

therefore, for a valid reference to be formed, we can assume 
that the qualifications are there, if any qualifications are 
there at all. thus, to resolve potential qualified lookups, we 
can note that if a (x0::x1::...::xA::a) was the undef definition,
and the reference to b (x(A+1)::...::xB::b) was the undef name,
then when b (x0::x1::...::xA::x(A+1)::...::xB::b) was defined,
the fully qualified name of b is what would be looked up in the map.




#QUESTION how do we handle globally qualified names being used in the 
ubd map?

public let b = ::a;
public let a = 1;

a matches ::a iff we add global qualifications.

module A {
  public let a = ::b;
}

public let b = 1;

b matches ::b iff we add global qualifications

public let a = ::A::b;

module A {
  public let b = 1;
}

A::b matches ::A::b iff we add global qualifications

module A {
  public let a = ::B::b;
}

module B {
  public let b = 1;
}

B::b matches ::B::b iff we add global qualifications

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
can we use a std::multimap to implement the UBDMap?

there are a few issues, mainly surrounding the interaction between 
use-before-def and modules/namespaces, related to the lookup process.

lookup walks up the scope tree.
qualified lookup can reach any point in the tree from any other point.

the way we have handled this has been on a case by case basis.

case 1: see if the def name matches the undef name 

case 2: the undef name is globally qualified, so we 
  globally qualify the def name and see if they match

case 3: the def name appears in a scope higher than the 
  scope of the ubd definition. thus unqualified lookup 
  will reach the new definition from the ubd definition.

case 4: the def name is qualified, so that 
  by qualified lookup the ubd definition would resolve
  the definition. so we prepend the qualifications of the 
  def name to the ubd name and see if they match.

case 1 can be handled by the st::multimap interface directly,

case 2 requires modifying the passed in name, so this can be 
handled by adding some complexity to the lookup method,

case 3 requires comparing the name to the undef name unqualified,
  after comparing the scope name of the ubd def to the scope of 
  the def name 

case 4 requires the qualifications of the ubd def name and the 
  normal name.

we can handle each of these cases with a lookup in the map each.
which makes for 4 queries per lookup, as opposed to handrolling 
something where we can combine the checks into a single call.
where we check each case for each name, instead of checking 
every name for a single case and then restarting with the new name.

however, is there another approach that would make this simpler?

well, we can abandon use before def and implement forward declarations.
(which I don't love)
or we could come up with another strategy for solvign ubd.
which might exist idk.
