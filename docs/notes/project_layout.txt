adt/ 
is where I have been placing classes which have a 
single resposibility within the compiler.
(the name is kinda meaningless at this point,
but it stands for algebraic data type.)

ast/
is for the abstract syntax tree of the compiler.

codegen/
is for the free functions which generate llvm IR
#TODO: maybe this isn't the best name, but idrk.
alts: implementation backend irgen llvmgen runtime

core/ 
is for the main driver functions of the compiler.

ir/ 
is for the intermediate representation of the compiler 

scan/ 
is for the scanner and parser which build the ast.


type/ 
is for the types understood by the compiler.

typecheck/
is for the typechecking algorithm
#TODO: this is a single file implementation, does it really need it's own folder?
maybe it goes into core?

utility/
if for free functions which are program utilities
